mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

cmake --build

cd build/src

./verbio_run "your paragraph" (the paragraph must be passed as parameter in quotes)

* there is also an already compiled version for linux, it can be found on bin/Linux, in case the building process is not sucessfully completed.

-------------------

There are some unit tests that can be run to test different cases.

-----------------

There are still some improvements to be done, as taking into account comas and special characters next to a number. For instance, Â¨three, four, five" will not be processed correctly.
